# Weather_analysis
Project Overview :-
  This project aims to analyze historical weather data to identify unusual temperature spikes and rainfall patterns over the past decade (2012-2022). By leveraging data analysis techniques, we aim to uncover insights that can contribute to understanding climate variability and its potential impacts.

Steps:-

1. Collect a Weather Dataset:
   - Gather a weather dataset containing daily temperature and rainfall data. Suitable sources include:
     - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
     - [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/)
  
2. Load the Dataset:
   - Utilize the `pandas` library in Python to load and clean the dataset, handling any missing or invalid data.

3. Perform Analyses:
   - Analyze the data to identify unusual temperature spikes and rainfall anomalies.
   - Calculate the correlation between temperature and rainfall anomalies.

4. Identify Unusual Temperature Spikes:
   - Determine the month with the most unusual temperature spikes over the last decade.

5. Detect Correlations:
   - Investigate the relationship between rainfall anomalies and temperature trends.

6. Visualize Anomalies:
   - Create visualizations using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`:
     - Generate a heatmap to display rainfall anomalies.
     - Highlight temperature spikes on a line graph.

Requirements:-
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

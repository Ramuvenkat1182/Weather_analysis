# Weather_analysis
Project Overview :-
  This project aims to analyze historical weather data to identify unusual temperature spikes and rainfall patterns over the past decade. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we aim to uncover insights that can contribute to understanding climate variability and its potential impacts.

Steps:-

1. Collect a Weather Dataset:
   - Gather a weather dataset containing daily temperature and rainfall data. Suitable sources include:
     - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
     - [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/)
  
2. Load the Dataset:
   - Utilize the `pandas` library in Python to load and clean the dataset, handling any missing or invalid data.

3. Perform Analyses:
   - Analyze the data to identify unusual temperature spikes and rainfall anomalies.
   - Calculate the correlation between temperature and rainfall anomalies.

4. Identify Unusual Temperature Spikes:
   - Determine the month with the most unusual temperature spikes over the last decade.

5. Detect Correlations:
   - Investigate the relationship between rainfall anomalies and temperature trends.

6. Visualize Anomalies:
   - Create visualizations using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`:
     - Generate a heatmap to display rainfall anomalies.
     - Highlight temperature spikes on a line graph.

Requirements:-
- Python 3 version
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
